To accomplish this objective we took advantage of two key approaches: the Web Components specification and a declarative approach of defining charts.\r\n\r\n![Multi-series chart](https://cdn.rawgit.com/felipe07/VistSOS-1/master/media/multiseries-chart.png)\r\n\r\n![Single bar histogram chart](https://cdn.rawgit.com/felipe07/VistSOS-1/master/media/single-bar-histogram-chart.png)\r\n\r\nFor the developer interested in mantaining or improving VistSOS the implementation of the aforementioned strategy will signify an easy design to explore, understand and extend. For the end user, the definition of new charts conected to istSOS will represent an easy task.\r\n\r\n### **Potential Users**\r\n\r\nUsers interested in the visualization of time series will take advantage of VistSOS. Visualizing sensor observations with one or two variables or creating histograms with different aggregation functions can open a new perspective to detect patterns and make meaningful comparisons.\r\n\r\n### **Capabilities**\r\n\r\n* Line/multi-line, multi-variable, overview-detail and histogram charts.\r\n* Easy configuration using parameters and the custom HTML element `<istsos-chart>`\r\n* Use of the Web Component specification to minimize the impact on the user website.\r\n\r\n### **Showcase**\r\n\r\nTake a look at some charts in the [VistSOS showcase](http://131.175.143.71/vistsos/test/showcase/#line).\r\n\r\n### **Commits and Repository**\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a look at the repository code please follow [VistSOS repository](https://github.com/felipe07/VistSOS-1).\r\n\r\nTo check the commits made so far please follow [VistSOS commits](https://github.com/felipe07/VistSOS-1/commits/master).\r\n\r\nTo check the documentation in detail please follow [VistSOS wiki](https://github.com/felipe07/VistSOS-1/wiki).\r\n\r\n### **Thinks to Improve**\r\n\r\nOf course there is room for improvement. Please take a look at the [VistSOS backlock](https://github.com/felipe07/VistSOS-1/wiki/Backlog) to see the list of features to be implemented.",
